# Exercise-3

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# cd
---
The `cd` command in terminal stands for change directory. It is used to change where in the terminal you are. For example:
`cd Desktop/`

Here are some more tips and tricks about the `cd` command:
* You can also use `cd` with ../ to go backwards in the directory
* You can put the direct path of where you want to go with `cd`. For example: `cd c/Users/NAME/Documents/Classwork`
